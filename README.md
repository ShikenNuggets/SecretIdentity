Roadmap:
* Custom city environment
* Enemies that spawn randomly throughout the city
* Destructible environments
* "Fear Meter" that responds to the number of enemies in the city, as well as collateral damage caused by you
* Other types of emergencies (fires, accidents, cats stuck in trees, etc)
* Traffic/Pedestrians
* Bigger and tougher enemies
* More to come!

Note: This is essentially a prototype to improve my Unreal Engine skills.
Note 2: Due to storage limitations, this repository does not contain game assets/content or playable builds. Only project files and C++ code.
